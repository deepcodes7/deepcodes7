Hi, I’m Pradeep Nadgir — an AI Technical Product Manager and former software engineer with 15+ years of experience delivering digital and AI-powered solutions across consulting, enterprise, and product environments.

I currently lead AI product initiatives at Deloitte Canada, where I’ve envisioned, built, and deployed agentic GenAI solutions that enhance delivery speed, insight generation, and consulting effectiveness. My work focuses on transforming traditional workflows into modular AI agents — helping teams turn complex, manual research and delivery tasks into intelligent, semi-autonomous systems.

🔧 My Stack & Focus Areas

    Agentic AI: CrewAI, LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith
    LLM Engineering: RAG, OpenAI API, LlamaIndex, Gemini, Serper, Perplexity
    Backend: Python, FastAPI, REST, cloud-native deployments (Azure/GCP)
    Monitoring & Guardrails: LangSmith, token cost tracking, evaluation utilities
    Consulting Innovation: Human capital, org design, agile transformation, delivery
    Agile Program Management: SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), Scrum, Kanban, Large Program Delivery

🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

**Multi-Agent Research Assistant:** Designed and built a LangGraph-based system integrating web search, PDF parsing, and internal RAG pipelines to deliver synthesized insights for consulting teams. Reduced time to insight from weeks to days.

**Agentified Delivery Framework:** Led the productization of an AI platform that breaks down the consulting lifecycle into reusable agents — from document intake to strategy synthesis. Actively being evaluated for enterprise rollout.

🧠 Always Learning

I'm a **Perplexity AI Business Fellow**, **Google Cloud Certified GenAI Leader**, and continuously exploring better ways to build ethical, explainable, and business-relevant AI products. Currently diving deeper into scalable architectures for enterprise GenAI and agentic frameworks.
